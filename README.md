Coal, Iron, and Gold now generate in desert stone.<br>

These new ores can craft into very strong tools and weapons. As of current the Infinuim ingots can be made into infinium armour, (soft dependancy to armor mod.)  You can consider finding Infinium winning the game.
To craft these tools you will replace the stick with an iron ingot.
To craft an Infinium ingot you must craft first a vessel with Infinium goo to get Infinium container and water flowing. then cook the Infinium container in furnace to get ingot.<br>


[TOOLS]

ES Sword and pick crafting is different than default minetest.
Aikerum, Emerald, Ruby crystals go in usual spots to craft, the handle however, substitutes the sticks for an steel ingot.

The main game for the Minetest game engine [minetest_game]
==========================================================

To use this game with Minetest, insert this repository as
  /games/minetest_game
in the Minetest Engine.

The Minetest Engine can be found in:
  https://github.com/minetest/minetest/

Compatibility
--------------
The minetest_game github master HEAD is generally compatible with the github
master HEAD of minetest.

Additionally, when the minetest engine is tagged to be a certain version (eg.
0.4.10), minetest_game is tagged with the version too.

When stable releases are made, minetest_game is packaged and made available in
  http://minetest.net/download
and in case the repository has grown too much, it may be reset. In that sense,
this is not a "real" git repository. (Package maintainers please note!)
