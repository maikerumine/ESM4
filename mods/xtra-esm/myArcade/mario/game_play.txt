The idea is to get all the coins. The turtles will walk around and if they touch you you die. 

The turtles would only need to walk on the x axis. It starts with 2 turtles. The come out of the pipes at the top. One from each pipe. After 45 seconds? 2 more come out. A total of 4. At the bottom I placed a portal to take them to the top again so they will always be in the game.

After all the coins are collected the game advances to the next level. Coins reset and turtles start over. Turtles go a little faster as the levels advance. 

When you right click on the start block the jump changes to make you jump high enough.

The M block in the game is an exit button. It will reset jump to normal.

Not exactly like the original Mario bros but it might be a fun game.

I did the basic set up but not sure how it would work with the api. I was studying your code but I still need to learn more to understand it.
