###Lavender Mod for Minetest by Xanthin

####Mod description

The mod will just add lavender to the map that gives you an item, that lets you listen to a
calm and moody melody. And violet dye. Its more a fun than a serious attempt to improve the gameplay. ;)

Look around for lavender bushes being generated at sand.
Pick them up, and get 2 or 4 lavender fruits.
You can put a lavender fruit anywhere into the craft grid and craft 4 violet dyes from it.

Use a lavender fruit when selected in the hotbar and enjoy the sound. :)
The lavender fruit also heals one health point (1/2 heart).
Isn't that nice to calm down after frustrating moments in or with the game. 

Ahhhhhh. :)

####Mod Dependencies

default (needed, for the node sounds and the default sand)

dye     (optional, if you want to craft violet dye from the lavender fruits)
