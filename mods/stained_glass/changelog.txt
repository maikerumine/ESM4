ver 1.7
Sat 1 Sep 2013
I like trapglass, so _all_ variants of stained_glass are now available as (identical) trapglass variants.   also, ability to ditch trapglass blocks via settings.txt added.  In fact, you can now pick and choose which variants of stained_glass you wish to enable.

ver 1.6
Fri 30 Aug 2013
added configfile settings.txt to allow disabling of full_light (super_glow_glass-based), med_light (glow_glass-based) and no_light (default:glass) blocks.  just set the relevant fields to 'false' and they will not be loaded when you start the game.  

ver 1.5.1
Mon 26 Aug 2013
prompted by VanessaE's initial cleanup, MUCH cleanup of the code.  No need to have > 1 file anymore.

ver 1.5
Sun 25 Aug 2013
added low-glow (brightness 11) and noglow (brightness 0) stained glass blows, using glow_glass and regular glass accordingly.

ver 1.4
Thu 22 Aug 2013
*phew*  made aliases for all numeric block names to map to new color-name based scheme
updated craft recipes to work with new dyes format
rejiggered whole system of block and craft registration
set to have all blocks at LIGHT_MAX -- since they were manually specifying '14' as a light level before (which is current max)
nothing returns buckets anymore, because you don't need buckets to make the dyes to make the blocks.

ver 1.1

Faint was too faint in-game, so I made 'em look more the way I expected.

Fixed recipes for pastel and faint blocks.

Also, made certain the faint blocks return two buckets instead of only one.

Think everything's in order.

ver 0.9

Sat 23 Feb 2013 05:23:17 5M EST 

Added light colors.
Attempted to order colors by hue.
Turned out to be a lot harder than imagined.

alpha-numeric order is goofy.

I was thinking it was doing:  1, 10, 11, 12, 2, 3, 4...
but it was doing:  10, 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4...

ver 0.8

Sat 23 Feb 2013 01:18:24 AM EST 

Fixed missing comma in script.

ver 0.7

Sat 23 Feb 2013 01:01:22 AM EST 

Added full saturation Medium and Dark shades.


---------


ver 0.6

Fri 22 Feb 2013 08:27:53 PM EST

Fixed a bug where I forgot a comma in the script.
Nothing major, but it wouldn't load unless it was in the right spot.

The blocks light up nice and bright.  Quite saturated.
Perhaps too intense for my purposes.
 
Will create more subdued colors, much more like actual stained glass.
Especially pastels, and flesh tones.

Perhaps turn the light intensity down.
Maybe make some/all of them out of standard glow glass instead.

ver 0.5

Fri 22 Feb 2013 06:42:24 PM EST 

Essentially the first version, but I'm starting at ver 0.5 because I want to check for bugs before it's released.

Has the Full saturation colors included.  (except for yellow, as super-glow-glass is already)
Haven't decided if/when I'll include the other colors.
Perhaps some/all eventually.
