Arrows are ammunition for bows and dispensers.=
An arrow fired from a bow has a regular damage of 1-9. At full charge, there's a 20% chance of a critical hit dealing 10 damage instead. An arrow fired from a dispenser always deals 3 damage.=
Arrows might get stuck on solid blocks and can be retrieved again. They are also capable of pushing wooden buttons.=
To use arrows as ammunition for a bow, just put them anywhere in your inventory, they will be used up automatically. To use arrows as ammunition for a dispenser, place them in the dispenser's inventory. To retrieve an arrow that sticks in a block, simply walk close to it.=
