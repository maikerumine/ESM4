-- radioactivity

-- Radiation resistance represents the extent to which a material
-- attenuates radiation passing through it; i.e., how good a radiation
-- shield it is.  This is identified per node type.  For materials that
-- exist in real life, the radiation resistance value that this system
-- uses for a node type consisting of a solid cube of that material is the
-- (approximate) number of halvings of ionising radiation that is achieved
-- by a metre of the material in real life.  This is approximately
-- proportional to density, which provides a good way to estimate it.
-- Homogeneous mixtures of materials have radiation resistance computed
-- by a simple weighted mean.  Note that the amount of attenuation that
-- a material achieves in-game is not required to be (and is not) the
-- same as the attenuation achieved in real life.
--
-- Radiation resistance for a node type may be specified in the node
-- definition, under the key "radiation_resistance".  As an interim
-- measure, until node definitions widely include this, this code
-- knows a bunch of values for particular node types in several mods,
-- and values for groups of node types.  The node definition takes
-- precedence if it specifies a value.  Nodes for which no value at
-- all is known are taken to provide no radiation resistance at all;
-- this is appropriate for the majority of node types.  Only node types
-- consisting of a fairly homogeneous mass of material should report
-- non-zero radiation resistance; anything with non-uniform geometry
-- or complex internal structure should show no radiation resistance.
-- Fractional resistance values are permitted; two significant figures
-- is the recommended precision.

-- Radioactive nodes cause damage to nearby players.  The damage
-- effect depends on the intrinsic strength of the radiation source,
-- the distance between the source and the player, and the shielding
-- effect of the intervening material.  These determine a rate of damage;
-- total damage caused is the integral of this over time.
--
-- In the absence of effective shielding, for a specific source the
-- damage rate varies realistically in inverse proportion to the square
-- of the distance.  (Distance is measured to the player's abdomen,
-- not to the nominal player position which corresponds to the foot.)
-- However, if the player is inside a non-walkable (liquid or gaseous)
-- radioactive node, the nominal distance could go to zero, yielding
-- infinite damage.  In that case, the player's body is displacing the
-- radioactive material, so the effective distance should remain non-zero.
-- We therefore apply a lower distance bound of sqrt(0.75) m, which is
-- the maximum distance one can get from the node centre within the node.
--
-- A radioactive node is identified by being in the "radioactive" group,
-- and the group value signifies the strength of the radiation source.
-- The group value is the distance in metres from a node at which an
-- unshielded player will be damaged by 0.25 HP/s.  Or, equivalently, it
-- is half the square root of the damage rate in HP/s that an unshielded
-- player 1 m away will take.
--
-- Shielding is assessed by sampling every 0.25 m along the path
-- from the source to the player, ignoring the source node itself.
-- The summed radiation resistance values from the sampled nodes yield
-- a measure of the total amount of radiation resistance on the path.
-- As in reality, shielding causes exponential attenuation of radiation.
-- However, the effect is scaled down relative to real life: each
-- metre-point of shielding, corresponding to a real-life halving of
-- radiation, reduces radiation by 0.01 nepers (a factor of about 1.01).
-- This scales down the difference between shielded and unshielded safe
-- distances, avoiding the latter becoming impractically large.
--
-- Damage is processed at rates down to 0.25 HP/s, which in the absence of
-- shielding is attained at the distance specified by the "radioactive"
-- group value.  Computed damage rates below 0.25 HP/s result in no
-- damage at all to the player.  This gives the player an opportunity
-- to be safe, and limits the range at which source/player interactions
-- need to be considered.
