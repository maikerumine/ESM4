"Items are transfered from the block at the wide end of the hopper to the "
"block at the narrow end of the hopper at a rate of one per second. Items can "

"Hopper blocks come in both 'vertical' and 'side' forms, but when in a "
"player's inventory both are represented by a single generic item. The type "
"of hopper block that will be placed when the player uses this item depends "
"on what is pointed at - when the hopper item is pointed at the top or bottom "
"face of a block a vertical hopper is placed, when aimed at the side of a "
"block a side hopper is produced that connects to the clicked-on side.\n"

"When used with furnaces, hoppers inject items into the furnace's \"raw "

"Hoppers have the same permissions as the player that placed them. Hoppers "
"placed by you are allowed to take items from or put items into locked chests "
"that you own, but hoppers placed by other players will be unable to do so. A "
"hopper's own inventory is not not owner-locked, though, so you can use this "
"as a way to allow other players to deposit items into your locked chests."

msgid "A chute to transfer items over longer distances."
msgstr ""

#: hopper\doc.lua:21
msgid ""
"Chutes operate much like hoppers but do not have their own intake "
"capability. Items can only be inserted into a chute manually or by a hopper "
"connected to a chute. They transfer items in the direction indicated by the "
"arrow on their narrow segment at a rate of one item per second. They have a "
"small buffer capacity, and any items that can't be placed into the target "
"block's inventory will remain lodged in the chute's buffer until manually "
"removed or their destination becomes available."

msgid "A sorter to redirect certain items to an alternate target."
msgstr ""

#: hopper\doc.lua:24
msgid ""
"This is similar to a chute but has a secondary output that is used to shunt "
"specific items to an alternate destination. There is a set of inventory "
"slots labeled \"Filter\" at the top of this block's inventory display, if "
"you place an item into one of these slots the sorter will record the item's "
"type (without actually taking it from you). Then when items come through the "
"sorter's inventory that match one of the items in the filter list it will "
"first attempt to send it in the direction marked with an arrow on the "
"sorter's sides.\n"
"\n"
"If the item doesn't match the filter list, or the secondary output is unable "
"to take the item for whatever reason, the sorter will try to send the item "
"out the other output instead.\n"
"\n"
"In addition, there is a button labeled \"Filter All\" that will tell the "
"sorter to not use the filter list and instead first attempt to shunt all "
"items out of the filter, only sending items along the non-filter path if the "
"target cannot accept it for whatever reason. This feature is useful for "
"handling \"overflow\" (when the target's inventory fills up) or for dealing "
"with targets that are selective about what they accept (for example, a "
"furnace's fuel slot)."
