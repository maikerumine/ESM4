# slap_rotate  


Easiest way to rotate nodes? :-) 
Slap node with glove! 
  
Glove recipe (like screwdriver, but uses wool instead of steel ingot):  
{ group:wool }  
{ group:stick }  
  
Usage - depends on config.lua: 

version 1:  
- left-click (dig) rotates node horizontally  
- right-click (place) rotates node vertically, based on players yaw  

version 2 (default):  
- left-click (dig)  rotates node horizontally  
- right-click (place) rotates node vertically, based on nodes face you are pointing
